In today's fast-paced world, it's increasingly important for CEOs to understand how their companies are performing in real time. CEO data dashboards offer a streamlined, connected interface that helps you track the performance of your business.

For CEOs, tracking both internal and external information is a crucial component of success. From cash balances, forecasts, and current sales revenues, to top-selling and worst-selling product lines, gross profits, and actual profits, there are vast amounts of information that must be monitored.

Of course, nothing can completely replace human interaction. Paper reports and in-person meetings will remain important components for gathering information, but in order to keep a finger on the pulse of your company's performance, you need reliable, secure technology to receive data and updates in real time, wherever you are. A CEO business dashboard allows you to do this and more.

##How CEO data dashboards work

A CEO dashboard uses an application programming interface (API) to connect all the company's computer systems at a single point of access. Data is dynamically generated in real time from the various sources - both separately and as aggregate reports. Users can view these reports from computers, tablets, or other mobile devices.

These systems can include, but are not limited to:

- Accounting software
- Sales spreadsheets
- Web analytics
- Competitive research
- Audience segments
- Revenue reports

CEO business dashboards make it easy to view overall company performance, monitor individual employee performance, and view other detailed reports and analytics using single or multiple data sources.

##What can you do with a CEO dashboard?

The centralised, integrated nature of CEO data dashboards allows you to view sales metrics, employee performance and more in real time, without having to spend time generating or chasing reports and spreadsheets.

With a CEO dashboard, you can easily:

- Display data from [multiple sources](/integrations/), including [spreadsheets](/spreadsheet-dashboards/)
- Integrate enterprise systems, cloud services, and [custom apps](https://developer.geckoboard.com) in a single, user-friendly display
- Improve data visualisation with easy-to-read graphs and charts
- Access your updated dashboard from any device with an Internet connection, such as your PC, [smartphone](/mobile-app/), or laptop
- Set up a [wall-mounted screen](/learn/guides/displaying-your-dashboard-on-a-screen) to keep your KPIs front of mind
- Pick and choose which data is displayed to create customised reports
- Quickly share data with anyone: department managers, shareholders, vendors, or customers

Simply stated, business dashboards streamline the decision-making process and help CEOs make more informed decisions based on overall company performance, as well as detailed data from relevant departments. These high-tech tools help to achieve a more efficient and seamless workflow. Standard security mechanisms help to protect sensitive data and provide peace of mind.

##CEO data dashboards and the future of business

The pace of modern business is picking up speed every day, and more CEOs are realising the power of improved data visualisation tools. With increasing competitive pressure and the growing power of 'Big Data', it's crucial for high-level executives and managers to be able to access real-time data across the organisation, along with the ability to apply that data to business processes in timely, meaningful ways.

The business world has entered a new era of data democratisation, and a growing number of non-IT professionals are driving the decision-making process behind business intelligence (BI) investments. CEO business dashboards deliver on-demand data access to the people who need it, regardless of time or location.
