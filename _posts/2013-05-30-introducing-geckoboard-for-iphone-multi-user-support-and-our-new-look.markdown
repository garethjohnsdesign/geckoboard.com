<p>We're pleased to announce the launch of some major new features for Geckoboard.</p>
<p></p><h3>Geckoboard for iPhone</h3><br>Firstly, we've launched Geckoboard for iPhone (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/geckoboard/id649272477?mt=8" target="_blank">now available</a> on the App Store). From the Wall and Desktop, to your pocket, you can now take Geckoboard with you and keep up to date with your important business metrics whilst out and about. The mobile app has been built specifically for those on the go, with data visualisations built to be attractive yet easy to interpret at-a-glance.

<p>The mobile app enables you to:</p><ul>
<br><li>View any of the dashboards in your account and switch between them</li>
<br><li>Swipe between pages and multiple charts on a single widget</li>
<br><li>Hide specific widgets and re-arrange the order of them</li>
<br><li>Select between a light and dark dashboard themes</li>
<br><li>Pull to refresh all dashboards from the Select dashboard view</li>
<br><li>Press and hold on individual widgets to manually reload them</li>
<br>
</ul><br>Don't wait, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/geckoboard/id649272477?mt=8" target="_blank">download it now from the App Store</a> (iTunes link) and login with your existing Geckoboard account.

<p></p><h3>Multi-user Support</h3><br>We've also added multi-user support for Geckoboard. This means you can now give others access to all or some dashboards to view and manage them. This is great for businesses who use Geckoboard across multiple departments or agencies who want to give multiple clients their own dashboards. You can create:<ul>
<br><li>Admins - with access to all account features, to help manage your Geckoboard</li>
<br><li>Power-users - who can create and manage all or some dashboards, but not access account information</li>
<br><li>Read-only users - who can view the dashboards you give them access to with a login</li>
<br><li>Groups - To help bring together users and dashboards in a manageable way</li>
<br>
</ul>
<p>This is available now for all new users whilst in <a href="https://www.geckoboard.com/free-signup/">trial</a> and those on <a href="http://www.geckoboard.com/plans-and-pricing/">multi-user plans</a>.</p>
<p></p><h3>New Look and Feel Geckoboard</h3><br>And last but not least, Geckoboard has been re-designed with new layouts for widgets, add widget and dashboard configuration menus and account management pages. We've removed unnecessary visual distractions, allowing you to quickly see and understand your data and more easily create and manage your dashboards.

<p>Enjoy!</p>
