<p>The Lean Startup movement swept through the entrepreneurial world, advocating a lean, iterative approach to finding the right product and market with a constant cycle of building, measuring, and learning. Now Lean Analytics dives deeper into the measurement component of that cycle. The best-selling book is being translated into eight languages, and its authors—startup veterans Ben Yoskovitz and Alistair Croll—have travelled the world teaching founders how to use data to build a better startup faster.<br></p><p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/lean-analytics-workshop-alistair-croll-and-ben-yoskovitz"><img alt="9004535925_919dc5eabe_k" class="wp-float-center" height="437" src="/uploads/0-9004535925_919dc5eabe_k-1024x682-2.jpg" width="655"></a></p><br><a href="https://www.udemy.com/lean-analytics-workshop-alistair-croll-and-ben-yoskovitz/" id="udemy-course-widget"><br></a><script type="text/javascript">// <![CDATA[<br />document.write(unescape("%3Cscript src='"+"http://www.udemy.com/static/js/embed.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E"));<br />// ]]></script>
<p>In June, 2013, Alistair and Ben presented an all-day workshop in conjunction with Geckoboard at London's Barbican centre, which we're now making available online. With energy, humour, and a disarming bluntness they'll take you through the concepts of their book: What makes a good metric; how to match the data you track to the stage of your growth; drawing lines in the sand; and changing the culture of organisations of all sizes.</p>
<p>In this workshop you will learn about:</p>
<p>• Lean Startup, Analytics fundamentals, and data-driven mindset</p>
<p>• Find the One Metric That Matters to you.</p>
<p>• Different metrics for different business models.</p>
<p>• Learn how to draw a line in the sand, so you know it is time to move forward</p>
<p>• How to apply Lean Analytics principles to larger enterprises and established products.</p>
