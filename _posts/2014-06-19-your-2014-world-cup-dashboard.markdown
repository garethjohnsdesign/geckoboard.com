##KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE BALL WITH GECKOBOARD

As much as we try to keep our focus on the right data here at Geckoboard, it seems that football fever has gotten through our firewall. It didn’t take long before one of our engineers, [Łukasz Korecki](https://twitter.com/lukaszkorecki), took the matter into his own hands and built a World Cup dashboard.

Use the World Cup dashboard to:

+ Stay on top of the match schedule (Know when to leave work early to make the 5pm game)
+ See the group results right in front of you (Collect the cash from your in-office bets)
+ Keep up with the official [@FIFAWorldCup](https://twitter.com/FIFAWorldCup) news on Twitter

Would you like us to add something to this dashboard? [Tweet us](https://twitter.com/geckoboard) and let us know.

Big ups to [software for good](http://softwareforgood.com/soccer-good/) for providing the data.
