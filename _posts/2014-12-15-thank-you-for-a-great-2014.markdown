**2014 has truly been a great year.** We’ve launched a new marketing site, welcomed new team members and continued to build the dashboard you’ve asked for. We’ve had a few ups and downs, but ultimately we’ve learnt invaluable lessons that have allowed us to sharpen our focus and [improve both our product and the overall customer experience](https://www.geckoboard.com/blog/topics/product/).

Before we get ready to take on 2015, we’d like to thank all our customers for their never ending support and feedback. Without you, we wouldn’t be able to do any of this, so from the bottom of our hearts: **Thank you**.

A special thanks to those who have stopped by for coffee, written about us, emailed, tweeted and all of the good stuff. We could never fully express our appreciation for the supportive community that surrounds us, but below is a shout out to some of you.

Thank you for helping us build a stronger product…

For putting food on our table…

And for allowing us to let loose every now and then.

Last but not least, after 2 years of faithful service, Mr White got promoted to VP of Barketing. The world is now a better place.
