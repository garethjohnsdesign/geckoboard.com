<p>We've been busy building out widgets and we're happy to announce another batch. These include new GoSquared, Mention and Vimeo widgets. We've also updated our Trello and AppFigures widgets. You'll find these under new widgets in the ‘Labs’ category in Geckoboard and they are there for you to try out and tell us what else you'd like to see as we continue to develop them. Here's some more information about the widgets:</p>

<p>The Trello Funnel Lists widget was also updated, so that it now lists the elements in the same order as in Trello. Trello credentials also now do not expire. The Current Rank AppFigures widget was updated to make use of their hourly, not daily data feed, so app rankings are now more up to date and you can now optionally include the app icon in the widget display. Whilst the Swrve widget was updated to allow you to make use of custom events and more advanced filters including, for example, currency data.</p>
<p>Log in to Geckoboard to try them out and let us know your thoughts and what other widgets we should create for them! We’ll be adding more over the coming weeks.</p>
