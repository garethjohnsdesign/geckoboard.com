To kickstart your dashboarding, we’ve gathered some examples of how different functions of your business can design effective dashboards for use in their day-to-day operations, using designs that are maximized for usefulness. 

This collection of **dashboard design inspiration** will help you visualize your own most important business data with style – just because a dashboard is functional doesn’t mean it can’t also be beautiful!

The following example KPI dashboards have been put together using sample business data and are all clickable live demos.


##Marketing dashboard

[![Marketing dashboard example](/uploads/marketing-dashboard-lg-1114-1.png)](https://demo.geckoboard.com/dashboards/2A87FA7656868037)

**[Marketing Dashboards](https://www.geckoboard.com/learn/dashboard-examples/marketing-dashboard-example/)** come in many different styles and you can customize them to focus on the KPIs that are important to your business. 

The example in the graphic above is a simple ‘overview’ style **Digital Marketing KPI Dashboard** for a hypothetical digital marketing team that's interested in monitoring how several different marketing channels are performing.

This imaginary marketing team is interested in bringing new visitors to their website, and their dashboard shows that they're currently focused on driving visits via organic search, social media, email and pay-per-click advertising. 

It’s a general KPI dashboard that shows a good breadth and depth of information for a small team to start acting upon.


##Sales dashboard

**[Sales Dashboards](https://www.geckoboard.com/learn/dashboard-examples/sales-dashboard-example/)** are a great way of highlighting important data to your team. By customizing your dashboards, you can focus on the numbers that matter to your organization while simultaneously creating real time daily sales reports that are constantly updating to reflect the new sales or leads that have been made by members of your sales team.

Sales Dashboards come in many different shapes so it's important to set out in advance what it is you wish to achieve and display. 

The **sample Sales Dashboard** displayed above is a great example of how less can be more when it comes to [dashboard design](/blog/dashboard-design-best-practices/). 

The sales team that put this dashboard together clearly understand that showing a focused set of carefully chosen KPIs can be more effective than showing a myriad of options for slicing and dicing data, or triggering gimmicky alerts or awards.


##Support dashboard

**[Support Dashboards](https://www.geckoboard.com/learn/dashboard-examples/support-dashboard-example/)** are an excellent means of monitoring support performance, ensuring that the numbers important to hitting internal support targets are visible and transparent and that customer needs, be they internal or external, are being met. 

The dashboard example above serves the support team at 'Metrix Foods', a fictional food manufacturer. Due to the nature of their work, the performance metrics that the team focus on remain more or less consistent throughout time. There is little need to update or add new widgets to the dashboard to support specific campaigns or projects, and this is clearly a dashboard that’s used to [monitor the day-to-day operations](/product/monitor) of the team. 

This dashboard is aimed at giving the support team visibility that things are on track throughout the day’s work and to quickly highlight any major issues as they begin to unfold. 


##Web Analytics Dashboard

[![Web Analytics dashboard example](/uploads/web-analytics-dashboard-example.png)](https://demo.geckoboard.com/dashboards/E751EDB2925D6C09 "Web Analytics dashboard example")

There are many different web analytics programs that help website owners see what is happening on their sites, enabling them to take steps to improve the experience of their users or make decisions that will impact sales or conversions. Google Analytics, Adobe Insight, Statcounter, Mixpanel and Kissmetrics are some of the better known packages.

However, finding the information that’s useful and actionable can be tricky, time consuming and lead you down a rabbit hole that creates more questions than it answers. Web analytics is one area where using a dashboard can have a huge impact on simplifying your reporting. 

A **[Web Analytics Dashboard](https://www.geckoboard.com/learn/dashboard-examples/web-analytics-dashboard-example/)** that measures time spent on site, unique visitors, bounce rates, top traffic providers and new versus old visitors is but one way of displaying important actionable metrics. 

An imaginary marketing team has created the dashboard above to monitor the performance of their website, using only [data from Google Analytics](/integrations/google-analytics/).

Overall, this is a solid overview of the website’s Google Analytics data and by displaying this on screens on the walls of the office, employees no longer need to log in to Google Analytics and struggle to find the number they need. A simple glance at their dashboard is all that’s needed.


##Devops dashboard

[![Dev Ops dashboard example](/uploads/devops-example-dashboard.png)](https://demo.geckoboard.com/dashboards/926E71734A72FE52)

Developing a website or app comes with a multitude of administrational tasks that require regular monitoring. A **[DevOps Dashboard](https://www.geckoboard.com/learn/dashboard-examples/dev-ops-dashboard-example/)** (**Dev**eloper **Op**erations Dashboard) is a great way of tracking them.

DevOps Dashboards help keep sysadmins and developers abreast of their software applications' mission critical key performance metrics like uptime, load time, api calls, cpu process threads, memory usage and the multitude of other components that help deliver a stable end user experience.

When building and maintaining software, there are inevitably times when things break. A DevOps Dashboard that monitors your core processes - even just a simple one - can mean the difference between spotting a bug before your users do, and finding a mountain of support tickets from angry customers. 

By bringing these core performance KPIs out from the software being used to track them, and giving them visibility on the wall, the team can see at a glance that things are running smoothly and react instantly when they’re not.
