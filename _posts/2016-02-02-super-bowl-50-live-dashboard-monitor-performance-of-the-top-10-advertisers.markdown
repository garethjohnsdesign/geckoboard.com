The Super Bowl is more than just a game. As [one of the most watched events in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl#Television_coverage_and_ratings), it showcases intense athleticism, brilliant - though occasionally thwarted - strategy, unpredictable entertainment, hyped advertising, and more food than you can imagine. It’s an American tradition we celebrate with friends every year. <br><br> If you’re not yelling at the refs, coaching the quarterback, or cheering for your team, you’re probably critiquing the commercials and speculating [which vehicle is starring in its unrelated ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lcc62nrl9Y). We all participate in one way or another. And this year, we’re excited to bring you a whole new level of engagement with a live dashboard: **Super Bowl Top 10 Advertisers.**

##Super Bowl Top 10 Advertisers
Ever wonder what impact a 30-second ad has? Or who’s getting the best bang for their buck? We’ve compiled a myriad of statistics and social trends to rank the top ten advertisers based on their estimated (using publicly available data) TV media spend. <br><br> Did you know that brands are spending approximately $167k per second of screen time during Super Bowl 50? That’s $5 million for a 30-second commercial. Crazy, right? <br><br>
Discover which advertiser gets the most value from their commercial with our Top 10 Advertisers Dashboard. You can compare the estimated total TV media investment for the top spending brands and monitor social mentions for each. Even more exciting is the live social sentiment calculated using all the positive and negative Twitter mentions (ranges from 100% for completely positive to -100% for completely negative).  

##QUICK SHOUT OUT TO MENTION
Before we give you the run-down on the dashboard, it’s worth giving a quick shout out to Mention. All the social mention and social sentiment data you see is being pulled from their [media monitoring tool](https://mention.com/en/media-monitoring/). So thanks to them for giving us a hand getting this up and running!
