<p><a href="http://www.goldstarfinancial.com/" target="_blank">Gold Star</a>, founded in 2000 by Daniel Milstein, is one of the premiere mortgage companies in the US. AJ Franchi, Chief Information Officer at Gold Star, told us how a need for an effective monitoring tool and performance tracking lead them to Geckoboard.</p>

<p>'We're a B2C business with all of our operations centralised in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Every year we have a commitment. Last year our commitment was to technology, so we went through the process of updating all our technology to make sure that we were going to be cutting edge in our sector across every department.</p>
<p>This year our commitment is to customer service, and thatâ€™s what initially spurred the need for a monitoring tool that could help us track our performance and help us deliver the best customer service possible.'<br><br><strong>Download the full case study to find out how Gold Star is able to live up to their promise and deliver the best customer service they can.</strong></p>
