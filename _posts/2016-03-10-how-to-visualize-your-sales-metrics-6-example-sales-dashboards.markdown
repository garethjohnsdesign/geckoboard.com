When it comes to dashboard design, sometimes you just need a little inspiration.

That’s why we’ve put together six different example sales dashboards to inspire you as you create your own. Although the possibilities are endless, we’ve selected the important sales KPIs to display on these dashboards.

For each example, we explain who the dashboard is designed for (the audience), the objective of the dashboard, and what <a href="https://www.geckoboard.com/learn/what-is-a-key-performance-indicator-kpi/" target="_blank">key performance indicators</a> are shown. Hopefully, this makes it easy for you to identify which dashboard (or perhaps multiple dashboards) best aligns with your needs.

##1. Sales Team KPI Dashboard (Option 1)
**Who’s the audience?**<br>
Your entire sales team - this includes Sales Manager/Leadership, Sales Operations, Sales Development Reps, and Account Executives. 

**What’s the objective?**<br>
This TV dashboard - displayed prominently on the sales floor - encourages healthy competition between sales team members by showing overall team performance compared against goals. The dashboard rallies everyone together and keeps the team focused on the most important metrics, as indicated by the large center widget for Sales This Month ($).

**What are the metrics?**
- <a href="https://www.geckoboard.com/learn/kpi-examples/sales-kpis/sql-to-win-conversion-rate/" target="_blank">Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs) to Win Conversion Rate</a>
- <a href="https://www.geckoboard.com/learn/kpi-examples/sales-kpis/average-sales-cycle-length/" target="_blank">Average Sales Cycle Length</a> (past 90 days)
- Sales this month vs Goal ($)
- <a href="https://www.geckoboard.com/learn/kpi-examples/sales-kpis/average-purchase-value/" target="_blank">Average Deal Size</a> this month (also called Average Purchase Value)
- Top Sales Development Reps (SDRs) by Leads Qualified
- Top Account Executives
- Recent Closed (deals)
- London Time / Date
- San Francisco Time / Date

##2. Sales Team KPI Dashboard (Option 2)
**Who’s the audience?**<br>
Once again, this dashboard is for your entire sales team - this includes Sales Manager/Leader, Sales Operations, Sales Development Reps, and Account Executives. 

**What’s the objective?**<br>
While this dashboard is visible to everyone, it focuses more closely on deal closers (i.e. Account Executives) and helps fuel a competitive spirit through leaderboards. The Sales Manager/Leader can easily identify the biggest deals (Top Opportunities) and understand how to best allocate their support and coaching to ensure the deals close. The Sales Pipeline (visualized in the bottom-right corner) makes it easy to see if deals are progressing through the sales cycle throughout the month. 

**What are the metrics?**
- Cumulative Sales this month *(The multi-line chart provides a great way to track against last month.)*
- Revenue this month
- Revenue this quarter
- Time / Date
- Top Deal of the month
- Sales Leaderboard
- Top Opportunities
- Sales Pipeline

![2-sales-team-KPI-dashboard-example](/uploads/2-sales-kpi-dashboard-example.png)

##3. Sales Manager KPI Dashboard
**Who’s the audience?**<br>
The Sales Manager (sometimes called Sales Leader) is the top dog - the person ultimately responsible for making sure the team hits the overall revenue goals.

**What’s the objective?**<br>
With an overview of the team, this dashboard enables the Sales Manager to monitor how his or her team is progressing towards their  quota. It also gives insight how each Account Executive is performing in terms of efficiency and pipeline performance. This dashboard would likely be displayed on a TV monitor in the Sales Manager’s office or on a separate desktop monitor.

**What are the metrics?**
- Sales vs Target This Month
- Sales this month ($)
- Value of New Opportunities Compared to Last Month
- <a href="https://www.geckoboard.com/learn/kpi-examples/sales-kpis/sql-to-win-conversion-rate/" target="_blank">Close Rate by Representative</a> *(also called SQL to Win Conversion Rate by Representative)*
- Value of 30 day Pipeline by Representative

![3-sales-manager-KPI-dashboard-example](/uploads/3-sales-kpi-dashboard-example-sales-manager.png)


##4. Sales Development Team KPI Dashboard
**Who’s the audience?**<br>
Sales Development Representatives (SDRs) source and vet leads - including direct outreach leads and <a href="https://www.geckoboard.com/learn/kpi-examples/sales-kpis/mql-to-sql-conversion-rate/" target="_blank">marketing qualified leads</a> - and then pass them along to Account Executives. The Sales Development Team (i.e. all the SDRs) focuses on qualifying leads and turning them into opportunities for the Account Executives to close. 

**What’s the objective?**<br>
This dashboard is created specifically to track and monitor the activities and performance of the Sales Development Team. It incentivizes the SDRs to outperform each other by showing three different rankings: Top Reps by Opportunities, Top Reps by Activities, and Top Reps by Lead to Opportunity Conversion Rate.

**What are the metrics?**
- Total Opportunities Created this month
- <a href="https://www.geckoboard.com/learn/kpi-examples/sales-kpis/mql-to-sql-conversion-rate/" target="_blank">Lead to Opportunity Conversion Rate</a> *(also called MQL to SQL Conversion Rate)*
- Top Reps by Opportunities this month
- Top Reps by Activities this month
- Top Reps by <a href="https://www.geckoboard.com/learn/kpi-examples/sales-kpis/mql-to-sql-conversion-rate/" target="_blank">Lead to Opportunity Conversion Rate</a>
- London Time / Date
- Opportunities Created by Day this month
- San Francisco Time / Date

##5. Sales Development Representative Individual Dashboard
**Who’s the audience?** <br>
Sales Development Representatives (SDRs) source and vet leads - including direct outreach leads and <a href="https://www.geckoboard.com/learn/kpi-examples/sales-kpis/mql-to-sql-conversion-rate/" target="_blank">marketing qualified leads</a> - and then pass them along to Account Executives.

**What’s the purpose of this dashboard?** <br>
This dashboard drills down further than the Sales Development Team and focuses on the individual SDR. Designed to be viewed every morning, the detailed metrics on the dashboard are incredibly useful and compelling for the SDR in achieving his/her quota for the month and, if accessible by the Sales Development Manager, enable them to drill down on individual SDR performance.

**What are the metrics?**
- Opportunities Created This Month
- <a href="https://www.geckoboard.com/learn/kpi-examples/sales-kpis/mql-to-sql-conversion-rate/" target="_blank">Lead to Opportunity Conversion Rate</a>
- <a href="https://www.geckoboard.com/learn/kpi-examples/sales-kpis/average-follow-up-attempts/" target="_blank">Average Follow-up attempts</a>
- Upcoming calls
- <a href="https://www.geckoboard.com/learn/kpi-examples/sales-kpis/lead-response-time/" target="_blank">Average Lead Response Time</a> (minutes)
- Activities Per Day This Month

##6. Account Manager Individual KPI Dashboard
**Who’s the audience?** <br>
Account Managers are responsible for managing existing customer relationships. They are responsible for renewing contracts, retaining customers, upselling and cross-selling. 

**What’s the purpose of this dashboard?**<br>
This dashboard provides a clear view of the Account Manager’s progress toward their goals (mainly upsells, renewals, and client satisfaction). The Average Client Happiness Score is usually calculated using a custom algorithm that incorporates several factors specific to your company (e.g. NPS score, product usage, surveys, etc.). Also shown on the dashboard is a list of at risk accounts, a powerful tool for preemptively addressing concerns or solving problems.

**What are the metrics?**
- Client Renewal Rate
- Average Client Happiness Score *(via NPS, or app to show how much client is using - product/service, surveys, custom algorithm, etc.)*
- Accounts at Risk
- Up-sells this month vs target
- Up-sells this quarter vs target
