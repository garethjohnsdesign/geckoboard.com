A few months ago, our growth team here at Geckoboard partnered up with the fine people at [Mention](https://en.mention.com/) for an exciting new project. We set out to collect growth advice, insights and anecdotes from some of the top marketers in the world.

Finally, the results are in and we’re excited to a launch our very first crowdsourced eBook. With over 50 contributing marketers from Moz, Trello, Everlane, Creative Market, KISSmetrics and many more, we’re pleased to present to you: **Food for Growth - 159 Secret Ingredients Served Up by the World’s Top Marketers**.

We’ve split the eBook into four scrumptious sections:

- Lessons: Marketers tell you about their learnings over the years
- Focus: Marketers share what they think you should focus on
- Innovation: Marketers reveal what they’re excited about for the future
- Heroes: Marketers let you in on who they look up to and why

We’re excited to finally be able to share this eBook with you and we hope you’ll enjoy reading it just as much as we enjoyed making it. 

**Go on and dig into 86 pages packed full of learnings, advice and honest truths about marketing. Oh and let's not forget, it includes an ALL CAPS foreword by FAKEGRIMLOCK.**
