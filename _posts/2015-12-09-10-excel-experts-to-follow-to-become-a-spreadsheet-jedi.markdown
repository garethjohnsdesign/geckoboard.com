I think it’d be fair to say many of us have a love/hate relationship with Excel. It’s a powerful tool for analyzing and manipulating data, which is probably why over 10% of the world’s population use it. However, for those of us with a less technical mind, it’s easy to get bamboozled by Excel, causing us to need a little help.

Given our [recent launch of Excel dashboards](https://www.geckoboard.com/blog/build-an-excel-dashboard-with-our-spreadsheets-integration/), we thought that we’d highlight some Excel thought leaders who can help level-up your Excel skills.
