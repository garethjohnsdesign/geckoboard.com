<p>Litmus are a long time user of Geckoboard, with a member of their team having first signed up back in July 2010. They have Geckoboard business dashboards running on a 60" TV in their lounge, showing key metrics to visitors and staff, as well on 10" Android tablets that are on the desk of every developer. They use these dashboards to monitor stats coming back from their staging and production servers and having it displayed on the tablets on their desks means that this important information is always available to the people that need it most.</p>
<p>Matt Brindley, CTO at Litmus, remarks that <em>"one of the things I love most about Geckoboard is how anyone on the team will jump into our account and build their own board. The widgets make it so easy to use!"</em> And as a result, its use has spread beyond developer focussed information like <em>"app performance... and project progress metrics"</em> to <em>"marketing specific metrics."</em> They use a mixture of native and custom widgets - Google Analytics widgets show their marketing site visitor numbers, along with a 30 day sparkline so they can see trends in them. This is shown alongside newsletter, subscription and trial signups and the number of cancellations and failed payments. It's essentially a snapshot of the marketing efforts of the company, available in one glance.</p>

<h3>Using Geckoboard to keep in touch with your customer base</h3>
However, what we really liked here at Geckoboard was when Matt explained how they <em>"also show a random 8 examples of customer work passing through our system"</em>, which <em>"keeps us abreast of how our users are working with Litmus"</em>. These are displayed using custom image widgets and are a great way to expose the creations of their users, which help them to keep their focus on the customer.
