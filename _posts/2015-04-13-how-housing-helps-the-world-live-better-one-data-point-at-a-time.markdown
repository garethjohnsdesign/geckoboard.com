**[Housing](https://housing.com/in) is on a mission to help the world live better.** The India-based real estate solutions system provides property hunters with 3D models and 360 degree views of the properties they’re interested in and, by doing so, eliminates the need for on-site visits and results in 100% verified listings. Fueled by a funding round of $131 million, Housing has now reached 5 million monthly users, making them the fastest-growing family in the real estate space.

[Darpan Khurana](https://in.linkedin.com/in/khuranadarpan), Business Intelligence Manager at Housing, told us about how data helps them run a more efficient and transparent business.


##“Data is the new soil”
Darpan and his team are responsible for uncovering new insights from the data that’s being collected across the entire company. They’re tasked with making sense of the numbers so that they can optimise operations and help the business grow. Originally, the team was working with in-house tools in order to help make sense of the numbers, but ultimately they lacked in connectivity and at the same time couldn’t offer employees a sufficient overview of the data.

Darpan and his team see data as a fundamental need for any business to operate efficiently.

>"Data is the new soil for us. It’s the foundation that we build everything else on top of." 

'Data is the new soil' means that the strategy is completely driven by data informed decisions. Darpan continues, ‘Data is the only way to find out what’s going on in our business and take the right actions that lead to growth.’

##A culture of numbers
Apart from the Google Sheets and Google Analytics, Housing utilises custom widgets to connect to their internal database to pull in and visualise the right data. These numbers are displayed on a total of eight TVs that have been installed across different departments, giving the employees a sense of what’s going on in the company. Installing the TVs and sharing the data publicly has had a positive impact on their KPIs. Darpan explains, ‘Since the visibility of people’s work has increased, they now not only feel like a vital part of the organisation but also more accountable, realising that the business is not just run by upper management, but they can actually have an impact on the business themselves.’

Previously, Housing offered data visibility but there was no real-time access or 24/7 visibility. At the time, employees only had a rough idea about how the company was performing and just a few people could answer that question when needed. Today, people know the numbers, they know how well the company is performing and they know exactly how to have an impact on those numbers. A 360 degree view of the data, if you will.
