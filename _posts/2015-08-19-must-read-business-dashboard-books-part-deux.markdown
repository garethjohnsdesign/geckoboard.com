Following on from my post on the [Two business dashboard books you must read before building your own](https://www.geckoboard.com/blog/two-business-dashboard-books-you-must-read-before-building-your-own/), I’ve had another peek in the Geckoboard library for more useful titles. Here are three more books that will help improve your dashboarding skills:

**How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of 'Intangibles' in Business – Douglas W. Hubbard**

![Measure_anything](/uploads/Measure_anything.png) 

This book introduces a practical framework for how to measure seemingly immeasurable things like customer happiness, quality, risk of a project’s failure, public image and much more. Hubbard combines the disciplines of economics, psychology and mathematics to create a hands-on way of helping you with your problem-solving and decision-making. Great for managers.

**The KPI Dictionary, Volume 1 & Volume 2 – The KPI Institute**

![kpis_vol1_copy_360](/uploads/kpis_vol1_copy_360.png) 

If you are in the early stages of setting up a performance management system, [The KPI Institute](http://kpiinstitute.org/about/)’s reference collection can come in handy as you search for your key performance indicators. Volume 1 is structured around functional areas like IT, Finance, HR and Marketing while Volume 2 is split into 25 different industries. In both you can find definitions of the KPIs as well as detailed calculation formulas. In all, this collection covers around 8000 KPIs.

**Performance Dashboards: Measuring, Monitoring, and Managing Your Business - Wayne W. Eckerson (second edition)**

![Performance_Dashboards](/uploads/Performance_Dashboards.png) 

Eckerson calls his best practice guide ‘a performance dashboard in book form’ because it’s glanceable, allowing you to stop and read more closely only when something catches your eye. It covers the historical context for dashboards, different types of dashboards, how to choose the right metrics and tips on design among many other things. The last chapter on how to manage the introduction of your dashboard, ensuring cultural buy-in and positive organisational change, is worth more than just a skim-through.
