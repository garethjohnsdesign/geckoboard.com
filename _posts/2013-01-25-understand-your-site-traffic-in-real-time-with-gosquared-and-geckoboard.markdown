<p></p><h3>Real-time analytics for your website</h3><br><a href="http://www.gosquared.com" target="_blank">GoSquared</a> helps you understand your site traffic in real-time, empowering you to make informed decisions quickly and efficiently. With this live data displayed in their simple dashboard, you have the ability to easily track how many visitors are currently on your site, where they're coming from, what they're engaging with, and a number of other important measures. Their API provides you with even greater flexibility to access and manipulate the data to fit the needs of your business.

Our integration allows you to see the following info from GoSquared, in context amongst your other widgets on your Geckoboard:<br><ul>
<br> <li>
<strong>Vistor gauge</strong> – The live visitor gauge is a number that represents how many visitors are on your site currently. This is a useful metric to identify traffic spikes, and gauge content popularity following a new blog post.</li>
<br> <li>
<strong>Visitor map</strong> – The live visitor map illustrates where your visitors are coming from. The maps are available in a few formats: global view, North America, Europe, and the UK/Ireland. Folks use these to show what's popular where, among other use cases.</li>
<br>
</ul><br><img align="right" alt="" src="/uploads/1-gs-2.png" width="303"><br><h3>Going deeper, with real-time visitor analytics</h3><br>However, there's a whole host of other features available within GoSquared. For example, they now allow you to show <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gosquared.com%2Fvisitors%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG3pmGvoWFR6mrLCg289sHgeU-hyA" target="_blank">real-time visitor analytics</a>. This means you can understand the individual movements of visitors, where they're coming from, and chat live with them - helping you turn more visitors into customers. We've recently added a selection of this data to our <a href="http://www.geckoboard.com/gosquared-widget/">Geckoboard integration</a>, including:<br><ul>
