[Morris Tabush](http://www.tabush.com/team/morris-tabush/) was a keen technologist from a young age. In college, he would always help out with IT problems and fix computers, so when he graduated the obvious next step was to start his own business. In 2000, IT consulting firm [Tabush Group](http://www.tabush.com/) was born.

Elliot Tabush, Systems Analyst at Tabush, told us about how they use Geckoboard to monitor their clients' servers and stay on top of their support tickets.

**Keeping an eye on 3000 computers with one screen**</br>
When I joined the company we were working on a lot of new projects and implementations and Geckoboard was one of them. We have a lot of monitoring systems in place to watch our servers, but our tech team needed some kind of visualisation of what was going on. They needed a way to keep an eye on our servers and make sure there was no downtime. We built a custom API that would tell us when a server goes down. Instantly, you'll see a message pop up on the dashboard to alert us so we can act on those issues as quickly as possible. This was one of the first things we implemented. Today, three years later, it’s still there. If anything goes down, a red piece will show up on the chart. So we'd know immediately, ‘Red on the screen! Something’s wrong.’ 

**A real-time gamification and motivation tool**</br>
We use [Autotask](http://www.autotask.com/) for our ticketing and support desk system. Everything that the technicians do, they have to enter into this program. Every support ticket that they're working on, they have to enter a note. So on the administrative side, they can then take that and determine how we're doing overall as a company; Do we need more technicians? Are we overworked? Are we underworked? Are we overstaffed? 
When we integrated Geckoboard with our ticketing system, the guys would see their names up on the dashboard and you could see who had the oldest support ticket. Then, if they're up there, people would say, ‘I don't want to be up there! I'm going to work on that ticket and try to close it.’ It’s a great way of motivating the team and also gamifying the process rather than pointing fingers at people. We don't want to put them on the spot too much, but you've got to do it somehow. When it’s up there on the wall, you just automatically look at it.
