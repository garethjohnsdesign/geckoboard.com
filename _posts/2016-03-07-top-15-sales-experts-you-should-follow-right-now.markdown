The most effective sales tactics and strategies aren’t taught in textbooks, but rather by the people on the frontlines, doing the work and seeing the results. The people who’ve learned best practices from their own efforts are the ones you want to follow. Those who’ve learned what works and what doesn’t from testing, iterating, and growing. 

Although we certainly believe you should test your own ideas, sometimes it’s nice to get inspired by those who’ve already been there and done that. By people who are on a mission to share what they’ve learned.  

Why do they do this? Because the world is a better place when people are good at their jobs. When sales messages are targeted and not spammy. When stories are powerful. 

Without ranting too much, here are the top 15 sales pros who share leading sales tips in real time. If you want to follow them all in one place, <a href="https://twitter.com/geckoboard/lists/sales-pros/" target="_blank">subscribe to our Twitter list of top sales pros.</a>
