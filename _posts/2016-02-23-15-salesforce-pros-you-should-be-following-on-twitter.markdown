Have you ever had that teammate who seems to know every software program inside and out? They know the shortcuts, tips, tricks like the back of their hand — the type of stuff you’re not going to learn by perusing the FAQ or help center. 

Since we've been working hard on our <a href="https://www.geckoboard.com/salesforce-dashboards/" target="_blank">new Salesforce Integration</a>, you could say we’ve been a tad obsessed with learning as much as we can about the program … in a good way. Which is why we just shared a <a href="https://www.geckoboard.com/blog/salesforce-implementation-6-steps-to-make-it-a-success/" target="_blank">six-step guide to Salesforce implementation</a> at your company. 

As we did our homework, we learned that there are several people out there who have a powerful knowledge of Salesforce.com, and they love sharing it! It doesn’t stop with Salesforce, either. They have a wealth of knowledge in sales, lead generation, pipeline management, business development and more. 

##Top 15 Influential Salesforce Pros
