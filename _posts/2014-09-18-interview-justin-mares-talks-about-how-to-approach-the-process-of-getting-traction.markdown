Every startup is on the pursuit of traction. But what does 'traction' mean? The definition is simple: Growth. How you are going to achieve growth is less simple, and the process of getting traction looks different for every company. 

[Justin Mares](https://twitter.com/jwmares), co-author of [Traction - A Startup Guide to Getting Customers](http://tractionbook.com/), talked to Geckoboard CEO Paul Joyce about what traction channels makes sense for your business and how to use data to gain traction.
