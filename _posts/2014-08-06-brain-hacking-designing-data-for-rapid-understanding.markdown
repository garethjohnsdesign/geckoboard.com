**[Data Summit 2014](https://import.io/data-summit) took place on June 27th in London. Among other amazing speakers, Geckoboard Co-founder and CEO, [Paul Joyce](https://twitter.com/paulmjoyce), took the stage.** 

##INTRODUCTION
Combined, the human eye and visual cortex form a data digestion and comprehension machine of immense power and sophistication. We're capable of consuming and understanding vast quantities of data exceptionally quickly, but only if we understand and respect the rules of how our eyes and visual cortex work together to process data. 
</br>
</br>
In this talk, Paul explains how we as humans process data and the practical steps you can take towards making your data understandable at a glance.
