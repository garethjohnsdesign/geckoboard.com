Focus your team on improving key business metrics with a live **Microsoft Excel TV dashboard** to monitor goal progress. 

Excel is a powerful piece of software for quickly aggregating numbers and calculating key business metrics, but it’s not a great tool for communicating goal progress to your team. After all, important metrics and KPIs can’t inspire action when they’re buried in a spreadsheet report attached to an unopened email. 

Make sure everyone in your company can understand goal progress with a live Excel dashboard powered by your existing spreadsheets.

Our flexible Spreadsheets integration makes it quick to build an easy-to-understand live TV dashboard using metrics tracked in an Excel file hosted in Dropbox, Google Drive or OneDrive for Business, that can focus your team on hitting company goals.
