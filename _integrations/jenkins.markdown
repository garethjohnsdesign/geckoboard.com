Build a **Jenkins dashboard** so your team can monitor the status of Jenkins jobs live on TVs around your workspace. 

We make it quick and easy to build actionable TV dashboards that display live metrics from your Jenkins account to focus your team on hitting goals and improving performance without having to log into your Jenkins account repeatedly or generate individual reports.

Easily create, edit, iterate and display focused dashboards using your Jenkins data that give your team full visibility on overall build health, build timings, commit messages and more using a drag-and-drop interface that anyone can use.
