Easily create, edit, iterate and display focused Facebook Ads dashboards that give your team full visibility on key metrics from a specific Ad, Ad Set, Campaign, or account as a whole. Clear and simple visualizations ensure everyone understands goal progress and any changes to key performance metrics such as clicks, impressions, spend, CPC, CTR and more.
