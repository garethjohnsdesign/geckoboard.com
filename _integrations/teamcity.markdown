Build a **TeamCity dashboard** so your team can monitor the status of builds live on TVs around your workspace. 

We make it quick and easy to build actionable TV dashboards that display live metrics from your TeamCity account to focus your team on hitting goals and improving performance without having to log into your TeamCity account repeatedly or generate individual reports.

Easily create, edit, iterate and display focused dashboards using your TeamCity data that give your team full visibility on recent builds, overall build health and outcomes for a specific project.
