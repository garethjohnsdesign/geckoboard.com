Easily build a **SQLite dashboard** that enables your team to monitor key metrics from your database on TVs around your office. 

Live TV dashboards bring key metrics out of your SQLite database and make them highly visible and easy for anyone to understand. With a SQLite dashboard displayed on a TV, teams can view live progress and prioritize their work without having to run database queries themselves or wait for a report. 

Connecting to your SQLite database requires minimal setup using our command line app [SQL-Dataset](https://github.com/geckoboard/sql-dataset) and our [Datasets](https://www.geckoboard.com/datasets/) integration.
