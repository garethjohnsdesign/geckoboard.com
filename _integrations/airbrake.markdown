Build an **AirBrake dashboard** so your team can spot errors instantly using TVs around your workspace and react faster. 

We make it quick and easy to build actionable TV dashboards that display live metrics from your Airbrake account to focus your team on hitting goals and improving performance without having to log into your Airbrake account repeatedly or generate individual reports.

 
Easily create, edit, iterate and display focused dashboards using your Airbrake data that give your team full visibility on recent error notifications, notices for your project, and more.
