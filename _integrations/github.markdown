Build a **GitHub dashboard** so your team can monitor live metrics from your GitHub account on TVs around your workspace to improve performance. 

Geckoboard makes it quick and easy to build actionable TV dashboards that display live metrics from your GitHub account so you can monitor recent account activity and issues without having to log into your GitHub account repeatedly.

Create, edit, iterate and display focused metrics dashboards that give your team full visibility on key information from a specific repository or account as a whole, including open pull requests, number of forks, watchers, issues, and a list of recent actions.
