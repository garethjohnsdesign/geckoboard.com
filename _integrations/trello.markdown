Build a live **Trello dashboard** to monitor the status of a particular project on TVs around your workspace. 

Live TV dashboards bring key information out of Trello and make it visible for teams to react instantly to changes on a board and focus on whatâ€™s important.

Easily create, edit, iterate and display focused Trello dashboards that give your team full visibility on key information from Trello including recent actions on a board or by a specific person, most voted cards on a board, a list of cards on a board and more.
