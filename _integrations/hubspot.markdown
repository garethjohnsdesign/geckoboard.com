Build live **HubSpot dashboards** to display on TVs around your workspace to focus your team on improving key metrics from HubSpot. 

Live TV dashboards focus teams to improve key metrics from HubSpot by turning HubSpot reports into clear, easy-to-understand, actionable and always-on visualizations.

With a HubSpot dashboard displayed on a TV, teams can view live goal progress and react instantly to changes without having to log into HubSpot or wait for a report. 

Connect to your HubSpot account and easily create, edit, iterate and display focused HubSpot dashboards that visualize your teamâ€™s key metrics and focus them on hitting goals rather than building reports.
