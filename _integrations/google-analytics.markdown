Build an easy-to-understand **Google Analytics dashboard** to display live website metrics on TVs and focus your team on hitting goals. 

Live TV dashboards focus teams to improve key metrics from Google Analytics by making them clear, easy-to-understand, actionable and always visible.

Easily create, edit, iterate and display focused Google Analytics dashboards from multiple sites so your team can monitor important live metrics, and clearly understand goal progress to improve site performance.

Displayed on a TV, teams can glance at their custom Google Analytics dashboard and react instantly to live changes without having to log into GA or wait for a report to be emailed to them.
