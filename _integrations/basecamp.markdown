Build a **Basecamp dashboard** so your team can monitor the status of projects in Basecamp 2 live on TVs around your workspace. 

We make it quick and easy to build actionable TV dashboards that display live metrics from your Basecamp 2 account to focus your team on hitting goals and improving performance, without having to log into Basecamp repeatedly or generate individual reports.
 
Easily create, edit, iterate and display focused Basecamp dashboards that give your team full visibility on to-dos, recent actions, upcoming events, and more.
