Build live **Salesforce dashboards** to display on TVs around your workspace to focus your team on improving key metrics from Salesforce. 

Live TV dashboards focus teams to improve key metrics from Salesforce by turning  Salesforce reports into clear, easy-to-understand, actionable and always-on visualizations.

With a Salesforce dashboard displayed on a TV, teams can view live goal progress and react instantly to changes without having to log into Salesforce or wait for a report. 

Connect to your Salesforce account in a click, and easily create, edit, iterate and display focused Salesforce dashboards that visualize your teamâ€™s key metrics and focus them on hitting goals rather than building reports.
