Build a **JIRA dashboard** so your team can  monitor the status of JIRA projects live on TVs around your workspace. 

We make it quick and easy to build actionable TV dashboards that display live metrics from your JIRA account to focus your team on hitting goals and improving performance, without having to log into JIRA accounts repeatedly or generate individual reports.

Easily create, edit, iterate and display focused JIRA dashboards that give your team full visibility on project status, tickets, issues and progress towards a release using a drag-and-drop interface that anyone can use.
