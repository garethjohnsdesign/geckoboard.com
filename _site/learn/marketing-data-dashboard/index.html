<p>Getting enough data obviously isn’t the problem. Neither is analysis. The issue comes with visualising the data in order to make sense of it all instantly. That’s what a marketing data dashboard is designed to do. That’s why so many CMOs and marketing managers are only now beginning to realise how powerful these data visualisation tools can be in overcoming a host of marketing challenges.</p>

<p>##What is a marketing data dashboard?</p>

<p>Data dashboards have been standard equipment for CEOs for years, but now <a href="https://www.geckoboard.com/blog/rhys-taylor-cmo-at-saasu-on-why-data-visibility-is-everything/">marketing managers and CMOs</a> are increasingly learning to explore their own data dashboards. At its heart, a marketing data dashboard is a platform that collects all of your KPIs and critical metrics into an artfully designed and intuitive display with information streams updated in real-time. Marketing dashboards can coalesce critical information from over 100 cloud services, while APIs pull data from your own proprietary software. Essentially, they represent a mobile headquarters to keep you better informed, so you can have all the information when making your most important marketing decisions.</p>

<p>##What does a marketing dashboard do?</p>

<p>Traditionally, marketing managers tend to get bogged down in spreadsheets and emails about recent market research. <a href="/learn/dashboard-examples/marketing-dashboard-example/">A marketing data dashboard</a> wipes all that away and replaces it with visualisations that are easy to comprehend at a glance and updated instantly. Additional benefits that marketing teams get from dashboards include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clear-cut guidance for decision-making</li>
  <li>A sense of ownership from having all the information they need to move ahead</li>
  <li>A focal point to help them ask the right questions and identify impacts</li>
  <li>Immediate feedback for agile experimentation and iteration</li>
  <li>The clarity to spot trends, seize possibilities and prevent looming problems</li>
  <li>An organising principle for a more data-driven office</li>
</ul>

<p>##How do you use a marketing data dashboard?</p>

<p>CMOs have to answer to many stakeholders about the status of all their projects, such as their branding efforts, lead nurturing programs, and social influence. Dashboards keep all of these projects on track with instant status reports. A dashboard can provide ready answers as soon as they’re needed, which improves communication, confidence and transparency across the organisation.</p>

<p>There are essentially three types of metrics that a marketing data dashboard should have available for testing and side-by-side comparison:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Online marketing metrics like click-through rates and mentions-in-network</li>
  <li>Soft metrics like brand awareness and customer satisfaction</li>
  <li>Hard metrics like internal rate of return and net present value of current campaigns</li>
</ol>

<p>##The future of data dashboards</p>

<p>Predictive analytics are the <a href="https://www.geckoboard.com/blog/interview-with-brian-kardon-cmo-lattice-engines-about-the-future-of-big-data-and-what-startups-can-do-today-to-leverage-the-power-of-data/">future of big data</a> and the CMO dashboard is the most likely place they will appear first in your organisation. Currently, a lot of marketing information is facing backward at what customers bought or said about the brand in the recent past. The next big step will be developing an understanding of marketing personas to the point where a CMO dashboard can identify market trends before they emerge. Marketing will be able to lead finance and operations in resource planning to take advantage of upcoming consumer behavioral patterns.</p>

<p>##The democratisation of data</p>

<p>We are entering a new era of data democratisation in organisations. The data is finally getting out to the people who need it, in a form that they can understand and use immediately. It is really these non-technical teams that are driving the demand for business intelligence and data visualisation. It makes sense because numbers don’t mean anything until they are put into action. Over the next few years, you can expect to see marketing data dashboards become as essential to CMO-level decision-making as a mobile phone.</p>
