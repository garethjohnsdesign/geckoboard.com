<p>You can have access to more information about your business than ever before. Better yet, you can have it in a format you and your people can actually use.</p>

<p>‘Big Data’ is an amazing advantage for any business, especially for sales and marketing. However, having more information available doesn’t mean your team is using it. More CEOs, sales managers and team leaders are using software to help convert numbers and other content into something that employees can understand and apply.</p>

<p>Data visualisation tools allow managers to interpret information faster and put it to use. Better yet, data visualisation helps create a new era of data democratisation within the organisation. Data can be shared throughout the company, and as people know more about how they’re performing, there are new opportunities for improvement.</p>

<p>For sales, data visualisation means a <a href="/sales-dashboards/">sales data dashboard</a>. This visual tool puts critical information about sales - calls, close rates, and any number of other metrics - into an easy-to-understand graphic format. Suddenly, numbers aren’t dry or intimidating, and they can be put to use.</p>

<p>Here are a few ways that the right sales data dashboard can benefit an organisation:</p>

<p>##Forecasting</p>

<p>By providing a picture of what’s in the sales pipeline, a sales data dashboard that includes forecasting of potential sales gives management and other staff a better understanding of the resources needed for production and fulfillment. The forecasting function can also uncover flaws in the selling process if the forecast is off dramatically from actual sales numbers. This gives the organisation the opportunity to make corrections, often before sales are lost.</p>

<p>##Lead management</p>

<p>Countless organisations are proud of the sheer number of leads they generate, even though they don’t know what happens to the leads after they come in. A good sales data dashboard puts this information front and center so everyone on the sales team can see conversion rates, lost sales, bottlenecks, and other issues that can affect the selling process. A sales data dashboard also allows multiple team members to follow leads through the system, providing support when necessary to help close the sale or - even more importantly - pick up any dropped balls that could cost the company business.</p>

<p>##Motivation</p>

<p>Sports teams keep score. So do businesses - but with money. Salespeople can be strongly motivated by how well or poorly they’re doing. A sales data dashboard provides a running scorecard as to how well the sales force is performing. The more this information is shared, the stronger a motivator it can become, as all salespeople know their contribution to the team. The dashboard can also motivate other employees to help salespeople boost closing rates, especially if there are incentives tied to performance.</p>

<p>##Follow-up and support</p>

<p>A sales data dashboard that is shared throughout the organisation can promote better support and follow-up, as lines of communication are strengthened between salespeople and other staff members. If a salesperson is particularly busy, or is away from the office, the dashboard can share information that may otherwise be lost or delayed. This allows other employees to know what needs to be done to support sales, even if sales or account managers aren’t available to follow up personally.</p>

<p>##Focus</p>

<p>There can be a big difference between activity and work, especially if an organisation is trying to grow. Too often, team members can get caught up on tasks that aren’t critical for success, and that actually impede progress. A sales data dashboard, particularly one that can be customised for the organisation, can help keep everyone focused on the work that truly matters and move the group ahead faster.</p>

<p>##C-Suite reporting</p>

<p>The visual aspects of a good sales data dashboard can be especially helpful for keeping top management abreast of the sales group’s work and effectiveness, particularly if the sales process is extended or complicated. Better yet, the dashboard can provide a way of reporting quickly, without the sales manager having to gather the data from multiple sources and then try to format it in a way that can be readily understood by top management. This can save hours, and make top management more comfortable with the sales team’s performance.</p>
