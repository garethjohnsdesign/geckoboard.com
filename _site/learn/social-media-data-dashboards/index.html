<p>There’s no question that social media data and analytics dashboards are becoming increasingly important to marketers, quickly democratising the decision making process by providing access to information. But what type of information is necessary and why? And what tools provide it best?</p>

<p>##What are social media analytics?</p>

<p>Often referred to as social listening, social media analytics are a way to monitor the effectiveness of your own social outreach and the sentiment of unsolicited conversation about your brand. Social data dashboards can also track who the most influential people in your community are across all platforms, what messages are having the most impact, and how all of this is affecting your business.</p>

<p>##Why are social media dashboards important?</p>

<p>While many people view social media as a free marketing tool that doesn’t require as much attention as paid marketing channels, quite the opposite is true. Nearly a quarter of all time online is spent on social networks, and over 70 percent of people make purchases based on a brand’s social media posts or a friend’s referral.</p>

<p>This monumental change in the way people purchase goods and services has spawned hundreds of companies, all with the goal of helping marketers wrangle the wealth of data around their consumers’ social activity. Social media dashboards make it possible to track this activity and use that information to drive decisions to the most advantageous for growth.</p>
