<p>Easily build live <strong>Google Sheets TV dashboards</strong> to focus your team on improving key metrics.</p>

<p>Google Sheets is a powerful tool for quickly aggregating numbers and calculating key business metrics. With a rich ecosystem of add-ons, plugins and scripts, itâ€™s also possible to turn your Google Sheet into a hub for data, with a handful of simple numbers updating every week, or a fully-fleshed application pulling data from third-party APIs every minute.</p>

<p>Our flexible Spreadsheets integration makes it quick to build an easy-to-understand live TV dashboard from metrics in a Google Sheet that can focus your team on hitting goals that matter to your company.</p>
