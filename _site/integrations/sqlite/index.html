<p>Easily build a <strong>SQLite dashboard</strong> that enables your team to monitor key metrics from your database on TVs around your office.</p>

<p>Live TV dashboards bring key metrics out of your SQLite database and make them highly visible and easy for anyone to understand. With a SQLite dashboard displayed on a TV, teams can view live progress and prioritize their work without having to run database queries themselves or wait for a report.</p>

<p>Connecting to your SQLite database requires minimal setup using our command line app <a href="https://github.com/geckoboard/sql-dataset">SQL-Dataset</a> and our <a href="https://www.geckoboard.com/datasets/">Datasets</a> integration.</p>
